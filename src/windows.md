# Windows

For now, the easiest way to get going is to install Linux on a virtual
machine, and follow the [Linux instructions].

## Windows 10 Insider Preview

If you are running Windows 10 Anniversary Edition (still an insider preview
build as of this writing; you must be running build number 14342 or later for
these instructions to work), you can get going by first enabling the Windows
Subsystem for Linux feature in the "Windows Features" control panel.

Once the feature is enabled, open a Command Prompt window and type ```bash```.
This will install [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows] allowing you to leverage Ubuntu
command line tools from within Windows natively.

Once you have installed Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, simply follow the [Linux
instructions].

## Other Windows Versions

I hope to have better instructions for Windows soon; since I donâ€™t have a
computer that runs it, I need to figure it out first. If you know how, this
would be a great way to [contribute](https://github.com/intermezzOS/book).
