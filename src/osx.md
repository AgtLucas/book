# Mac OS X

For now, the easiest way to get going is to install Linux on a virtual
machine, and follow the [Linux instructions](./linux.html).

Otherwise, to install the other tools on Mac OS X, make sure to have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed.

Then you can run the following command:

```
brew install nasm xorriso qemu
```
