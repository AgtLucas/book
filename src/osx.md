# Mac OS X

For now, the easiest way to get going is to install Linux on a virtual
machine, and follow the [Linux instructions](./linux.html).

I hope to have better instructions for OS X soon; since I donâ€™t have a
computer that runs it, I need to figure it out first. If you know how,
this would be a great way to [contribute](https://github.com/intermezzOS/book).
