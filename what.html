                    <h1>What is an OS?</h1>
<p>It’s actually kind of difficult to define what an operating system is. There
are a lot of different kinds of operating systems, and they all do different
kinds of things.</p>
<p>There are some shared goals, however. Let’s try this out as a working
definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An operating system is a program that provides a platform for other
programs. It provides two things to these programs: abstractions and
isolation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is good enough for now. Let’s consider this a test for inclusion,
but not exclusion. In other words, things that fit this definition
<em>are</em> operating systems, but things that don’t may or may not be,
we don’t quite know.</p>
<h2>Creating abstractions</h2>
<p>There are many reasons to create a platform for other programs, but a
common one for operating systems is to abstract over hardware.</p>
<p>Consider a program, running on some hardware:</p>
<p><img alt="program on hardware" class="center" src="assets/program_hardware.png" /></p>
<p>This program will need to know <em>exactly</em> about what kind of hardware exists.
If you want to run it on a different computer, it will have to know exactly
about that computer too. And if you want to write a second program, you’ll
have to re-write all of that code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of
indirection.</p>
<ul>
<li>David Wheeler</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve this problem, we can introduce an abstraction:</p>
<p><img alt="program on os on hardware" class="center" src="assets/program_os_hardware.png" /></p>
<p>Now, the operating system can handle the details of the hardware, and provide
an API for it. A program can be written for that operating system’s API, and
can then run on any hardware that the operating system supports.</p>
<p>At some point, though, we developed many operating systems. Since operating
systems are platforms, most people pick one and have only that one on their
computer. So now we have a problem that looks the same, but is a bit
different: our program is now specific to an OS, rather than specific to
a particular bit of hardware.</p>
<p>To solve this, some programming languages have a ‘virtual machine.’ This
was a bit selling point of Java, for example: the Java Virtual Machine.
The idea here is that we create a <em>virtual</em> machine on top of the <em>real</em>
machine.</p>
<p><img alt="program on vm " class="center" src="assets/program_vm_os_hardware.png" /></p>
<p>Now, you write programs for the Java Virtual Machine, which is then ported
to each operating system, which is then ported to all the hardware. Whew!</p>
<p>This, of course, leads to the collary to the previous maxim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...except for the problem of too many layers of indirection.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevlin Henney</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We now have a pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have <code>A</code>.</li>
<li><code>A</code> is written explicitly for <code>X</code>...</li>
<li>... but I want to support <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>,</li>
<li>so I put abstraction <code>B</code> in the middle.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will see this pattern over and over again. Hence ‘intermezzo’: abstractions
are always in the middle.</p>
<h2>Isolation</h2>
<p>Many of the abstractions provided are, as we discussed, abstractions over
hardware. And hardware often has a pretty serious restriction: only one
program can access the hardware at a time. So if our operating system is going
to be able to run multiple programs, which is a common feature of many
operating systems, we’ll also need to make sure that multiple programs cannot
access hardware at the same time.</p>
<p>This really applies to more than just hardware though: once we have two
programs, it would not be ideal to let them mess with each other. Consider any
sort of program that deals with your password: if programs could mess with each
other’s memory and code, then a program could trivially steal your password
from another program!</p>
<p>This is just one symptom of a general problem. It’s much better to isolate
programs from each other, for a number of different reasons. For now, we’ll
just consider isolation as one of our important jobs, as OS authors.</p>
<h3>Wait a minute...</h3>
<p>Here’s a question for you to ponder: if we didn’t provide isolation, isn’t that
just a poor abstraction? In other words, if we had an abstraction where we
could interact with other things being abstracted... isn’t that just a bad job
of doing the abstraction? And in that sense, is the only thing an operating
system does abstraction? Is the only thing everything does abstraction?</p>
<p>I don’t have answers for you. If you figure it out, let me know...</p>
