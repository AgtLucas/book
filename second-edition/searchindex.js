But the question is what in nomad life is a principle and what is only a consequence. To begin with, although the points determine paths, they are strictly subordinated to the paths they determine, the reverse happens with the sedentary. The water point is reached only in order to be left behind; every point is a relay and exists only as a relay. A path is always between two points, but the in-between has taken on all the consistency and enjoys both an autonomy and a direction of its own. The life of the nomad is the intermezzo. Deleuze and Guattari, “A Thousand Plateaus”, p380 If you’re not into particular kinds of philosophy, this quote won’t mean a lot. Let’s look at the dictionary definition: An intermezzo, in the most general sense, is a composition which fits between other musical or dramatic entities, such as acts of a play or movements of a larger musical work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermezzo I want this project to be about learning. Learning is often referred to as a journey. You start off in ignorance and end in knowledge. In other words, ‘learning’ is that part in the middle, the in-between state. The tricky thing about learning is, you never stop learning. Once you learn something, there’s something new to learn, and you’re on a journey again. If you want to learn a lot, then you’ll find yourself perpetually in the middle. There is another sense by which this name makes sense: as we’ll learn in the beginning of the book, operating systems are largely about abstractions. And abstractions are themselves ‘in the middle’, between what they’re abstracting and who they are abstracting it for."},"hello-world/setup.html#the-compiler-and-other-tools":{"id":"hello-world/setup.html#the-compiler-and-other-tools","body":"Next, we need to get the Rust compiler installed.

The core component is called a ‘kernel’. The non-kernel bits of an operating system are collectively called a ‘userland’. Typically a kernel has more direct access to the machine than a userland and thus acts somewhat like a super user (with powers that even ‘sudo’ cannot give you). A kernel forms the basis of the abstractions and isolations. So, as OS developers, when we categorize operating systems, we tend to categorize them by what kinds of kernel they have. By the way... Although you may be used to hearing the term ‘Linux’ used as a name for an operating system, you may hear some people say, “It’s GNU/Linux, not Linux.” That’s because virtually all Linux distributions today use a Linux kernel + a GNU userland. So the GNU folks are a bit annoyed that the kernel gets all the credit. By the same token, a lot of people say ‘the kernel’ when they mean ‘the Linux kernel.’ This gets an entirely different set of people mad. At the start, our ‘operating system’ will be just the kernel, and so we’ll tend to focus on kernels for the first part of our journey. The way that we categorize different kernels largely comes down to “what is in the kernel and what is in userspace.” Upon reading this, you might then think the easiest kind of kernel to write is the smallest, where everything is in userspace. After all, smaller should be easier, right? Well... that’s not actually true.

For example, many operating systems are often marketed as coming equipped with a web browser or email client. Are web browsers and email clients essential to operating systems? Many would argue the answer is no. There are some shared goals we can find among all operating systems, however.

Rust will allow us to write: // foo.rs use std::process; fn main() { let mut a = 0; for _ in 0..10 { a = a + 1; } process::exit(a);\n} This does the same thing as our assembly code: $ rustc foo.rs # compile our Rust code to foo\n$ ./foo # run it\n$ echo $? # print out the exit code\n10\n$ That Rust code probably looks more like a programming language you’ve used in the past. It’s a lot nicer to write complex things in a higher-level programming language like Rust. That said, virtually all languages are higher-level than assembly, so that’s not saying all that much. Rust is still a low-level language by many standards. So why choose Rust? Well, I’m picking it for two reasons: I love it. There aren’t a lot of kernels in it yet. There are a suprising number of people working on kernels in Rust. But since it’s a newer language, there aren’t nearly as many as for older, more established languages.","title":"Rust","breadcrumbs":"Background » Rust"},"background/index.html#background":{"id":"background/index.html#background","title":"Background","breadcrumbs":"Background","body":"Before we get going, we should probably have some idea of where we’re headed."},"background/what.html#creating-abstractions":{"body":"There are many reasons to create a platform for other programs, but a common one for operating systems is to abstract over hardware. Consider a program, running on some hardware: This program will need to know exactly about what kind of hardware exists. If you want to run it on a different computer, it will have to know exactly about that computer too. And if you want to write a second program, you’ll have to re-write a bunch of code for interacting with the hardware. All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection. David Wheeler To solve this problem, we can introduce an abstraction: Now, the operating system can handle the details of the hardware, and provide an API for it. A program can be written for that operating system’s API, and can then run on any hardware that the operating system supports. At some point, though, we developed many operating systems. Since operating systems are platforms, most people pick one and have only that one on their computer. So now we have a problem that looks the same, but is a bit different: our program is now specific to an OS, rather than specific to a particular bit of hardware. To solve this, some programming languages have a ‘virtual machine.’ This was a big selling point of Java, for example: the Java Virtual Machine. The idea here is that we create a virtual machine on top of the real machine. Now, you write programs for the Java Virtual Machine, which is then ported to each operating system, which is then ported to all the hardware. Whew! This, of course, leads to the corollary to the previous maxim: ...except for the problem of too many layers of indirection. Kevlin Henney We now have a pattern: I have A . A is written explicitly for X ... ... but I want to support X and Y , so I put abstraction B in the middle. We will see this pattern over and over again. Hence ‘intermezzo’: abstractions are always in the middle.","title":"Creating abstractions","id":"background/what.html#creating-abstractions","breadcrumbs":"Background » Creating abstractions"},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#setting-up-a-project":{"breadcrumbs":"From Zero to \"Hello, world!\" » Setting up a project","id":"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#setting-up-a-project","body":"Now that we are all set up, let's get going!

If the basis of computer science is abstraction, the very bottom of the software abstraction layer is assembly. Below it lies only hardware and physics. There are many kinds of assembly languages each targeted at different ‘instruction set’ architectures (also known as ISA or simply as instruction sets). These instruction sets are the list of commands that a given CPU can understand. For example, if your computer has an Intel Pentium processor of some kind then it understands the x86 instruction set. So if you were to write assembly for another instruction set (say MIPS or ARM), you would not be able to run it on your computer. This is one of the reasons we'll want to get away from the assembly world as fast as possible. If we want our kernel to work for a bunch of different architectures, any code we end up writing in assembly will need to be duplicated. However, if we use a more high-level language like C, C++ or the language we'll really be using, Rust, we can write the code once and cross-compile to different architectures. Assembly language looks like this: ; foo.asm section .data\nglobal _start _start: mov rax, 0\nloop: add rax, 1 cmp rax, 10 jne loop mov rbx, rax mov rax, 1 int 80h This is a little program in assembly language. If it looks totally alien to you, don't worry. While we could write our entire kernel in assembly, we'll only be learning as much assembly as we need to not have to use it any more. When you write assembly language you are actually directly manipulating the individual registers of the CPU and memory inside of RAM and other hardware devices like CD drives or display screens. By the way... CPUs are composed of registers each of which can only hold small amounts of data. The amount of data a register can hold dictates what type of CPU the register belongs to. If you didn't know why your machine is classified as either 32 bit or 64 bit it's because the machine's registers can either hold 32 bits of data at a time or 64 bits at a time. In assembly we can only do very simple things: move data between registers or to/from RAM; perform simple arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division; compare values in different registers, and based on these comparisons jump to different points in our code (à la GOTO). Fancy high level concepts like while loops and if statements, let alone garbage collection are nowhere to be found. Even functions as you know them aren't really supported in assembly. Each assembly program is just a bunch of data in registers or in memory and a list of instructions, carried out one after the other. For instance, in our code above we used the mov instruction several times to move values into specific registers with weird names like rax and rbx . We used the cmp instruction to compare the value inside of the rax register with the number 10 . We used the jne instruction to jump to another part of our code if the numbers we just compared were not equal. Finally we used the int instruction to trigger a hardware int errupt. Again, you don't need to fully understand this program at this point. Right now you should just have an impression for how assembly is composed of simple instructions that do very simple things. When it comes time to write some actual assembly code we'll touch on all this again. Let's run this little program: $ nasm -f elf64 foo.asm # assemble into foo.o\n$ ld foo.o # link into a.out\n$ ./a.out # run it\n$ echo $? # print out the exit code\n10\n$ Don't worry too much about what programs we're using to actually compile (or ‘assemble’ as it's known in the assembly world) our program. We'll be going over each one of these commands and explaining what they are and how to use them.","id":"background/tools.html#assembly","title":"Assembly"},"preface.html#the-story":{"breadcrumbs":"The Story","title":"The Story","body":"A long time ago, in college, my friends and I were working on a hobby operating system, XOmB . It was... tough. Frankly, while I learned a lot, I was a pretty minor contributor. I got frustrated too easily. One day, I found Ruby, and I was pretty much done with low-level programming. I had done it most of my life, and I was bored. Bored, and sick of dealing with core dumps. Those details aren’t that important. What is important is that over the years, I’ve always wanted to get back into this stuff. But the problem is this: there are a lot of people who do hobby operating system work, but... I don’t like their attitudes. You see, a lot of people see low-level programming as some kind of superior, only-for-the-smartest kind of thing. They have a puritanical world-view: “I suffered to learn this, so you too must suffer to build character.” I think that’s short sighted. Low level programming is difficult to get into, but that says more about the teachers’ faults than the students’. Anyway, as my professional life has moved back towards the low level, I’ve been thinking about this topic a lot again. That’s when I found an awesome link: Writing an OS in Rust by Philipp Oppermann . I cannot speak enough about how awesome Phil’s tutorial is; it single-handedly inspired me to get back into operating systems. The big difference with Phil’s tutorial is that it doesn’t treat you as being stupid for not knowing ‘the basics’. It doesn’t say “spend hours debugging this thing, because I did.” It doesn’t insult you for being new. It just explains the basics of a kernel. It’s amazing how much a little bit of a framing can completely change the way you see something. When the examples I found were all about how you have to be an amazing rockstar ninja and we won’t give you all the code because you suck if you can’t figure it out, I hated this stuff. When it was kind, understanding, and helpful, I couldn’t get enough. Once I got to a certain part in Phil’s tutorial, I started implementing stuff myself. A lot of the initial code here is going to be similar to Phil’s. But I’m going to write about it anyway. There’s a good reason for that: Writing is nature’s way of showing us how sloppy our thinking is. Leslie Lamport By re-explaining things in my own words, I hope to understand it even better. This is just a perpetual theme with me: I like teaching because it helps me learn. I like writing because it helps me understand. We'll be using a tool Phil developed called bootimage , and we'll explain similar concepts, but with different code and in different ways, and in a different order. Furthermore, I will not commit to any kind of schedule for this project. It’s going to be in my spare time, and I’m learning a lot of this as I go, too.","id":"preface.html#the-story"},"background/what.html#isolation":{"title":"Isolation","body":"Many of the abstractions provided are, as we discussed, abstractions over hardware. And hardware often has a pretty serious restriction: only one program can access the hardware at a time. So if our operating system is going to be able to run multiple programs, which is a common feature of many operating systems, we’ll also need to make sure that multiple programs cannot access hardware at the same time. This really applies to more than just hardware though: it also applies to shared resources (e.g. memory). Once we have two programs, it would be ideal to not let them mess with each other. Consider any sort of program that deals with your password: if programs could mess with each other’s memory and code, then a program could trivially steal your password from another program! This is just one symptom of a general problem. It’s much better to isolate programs from each other, for a number of different reasons.

These two attributes tell Rust, \"hey, we don't want a standard library, and we don't want a main function.\" When writing an OS, we want full control over the details. The Rust standard library assumes that an operating system exists, and we don't have any of that yet, so we can't use it. Rust's default main includes stuff that we could use, but it's nicer to write our own, so we have that full control. #![feature(lang_items)] // ... #[lang = \"panic_fmt\"]\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn rust_begin_panic( _msg: core::fmt::Arguments, _file: &'static str, _line: u32, _column: u32,\n) -> ! { loop {}\n} When we don't include the standard library, then we're missing one important thing: if we panic! , Rust wants to call a callback before aborting. This is that callback. For now, we'll just loop forever. As such, all the arguments start with _ , so that Rust won't warn us that the parameters are unused. The #[lang] attribute is what makes Rust understand that that's what this function for. Other than that, this is boilerplate: Rust itself determines the exact arguments and the rest of it. We'll talk about this stuff more when we actually do something on panics; for now, don't worry about it. // ... #[no_mangle]\npub fn _start() -> ! { loop {}\n} This is our main function, even though it's named _start . Have you ever wondered how main gets called? Technically, _start gets called first, then that calls your main function. Any setup code goes in _start , and would run before it calls main . Let's explain this function in a bit more detail. The #[no_mangle] attribute says \"hey Rust, it's really important that this function is named exactly this.\" You see, Rust is free to rename functions for you. There's good reasons for this that we won't get into here. This attribute disables that. If Rust renamed this function, then we wouldn't be able to boot up properly.

It's called a \"triple\" becuase it has three parts: the CPU, the vendor, and the OS. So for this target, we choose the x86_64 CPU, an 'unknown' vendor since we're not a big company or something, and 'none' for the OS, since our OS does not rely on an OS. \"data-layout\": \"e-m:e-i64:64-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128\", This is another LLVM thing, you can find the documentation here . Honestly, it's not very interesting; feel free to read those docs if you want to learn more. \"arch\": \"x86_64\", This also sets our CPU architecture; as we said in the target above, it's x86_64 . \"target-endian\": \"little\", \"Endian-ness\" is a property of how binary numbers are transmitted; there are three forms: \"big endian,\" \"little endian,\" and \"network endian\", which is a synonym for \"big endian.\" This is because most network protocols choose big endian. Intel uses little endian for their processors, however, and so we set that here. \"target-pointer-width\": \"64\", We're building a 64-bit OS, so our pointers are 64 bits wide. If you don't know what a pointer is, don't worry about it yet. \"target-c-int-width\": \"32\", We're not using C, so this doesn't matter, but if we were, we'd make integers 32 bits. This is common on the x86_64 platform. \"os\": \"none\", We don't have an OS! We're building one! \"linker-flavor\": \"ld.lld\", We'll be using LLD for linking; this linker is provided by the LLVM project, and automatically distributed with Rust. \"executables\": true, Are executables allowed on this target, or only libraries? That might sound silly, but iOS, for example, won't let you create executables. \"features\": \"-mmx,-sse,+soft-float\", These flags control the kind of code that Rust generates. For reasons we won't get into right now, many kernels don't use floating point numbers or SIMD registers in the kernel, so we want to turn those options off. (MMX is a similar feature to SIMD). \"soft float\" means to not use actual floating point hardware instructions, but to emulate them in software. We won't be using floating point numbers at all, directly, but just in case, we want to make sure that we're not going to be using the hardware for it. We'll talk more about this later. \"disable-redzone\": true, This is a very tricky one! The x86_64 \"calling convention\", that is, the way that assembly code for functions is called, allows for a thing called the \"red zone.\" We do not want this for a kernel. Forgetting this setting runs into all kinds of really strange looking bugs. \"panic-strategy\": \"abort\" Finally, we don't want to use Rust's panics, so by setting them to abort instead of unwind, we don't generate code to handle panics.","title":"Appendix A: target specifications","breadcrumbs":"Appendix A: target specifications"}},"docInfo":{"preface.html#the-story":{"body":252,"breadcrumbs":1,"title":1},"background/what-kind-is-there.html#monolithic-kernels":{"title":2,"body":53,"breadcrumbs":3},"background/what-kind-are-we-making.html#what-kind-are-we-making":{"body":94,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":3},"preface.html#preface":{"title":1,"body":108,"breadcrumbs":1},"background/what.html#isolation":{"body":92,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":2},"background/what-kind-is-there.html#microkernels":{"body":73,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":2},"appendix/target-specifications.html#appendix-a-target-specifications":{"title":3,"body":297,"breadcrumbs":3},"hello-world/index.html#from-zero-to-hello-world":{"breadcrumbs":3,"title":3,"body":66},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#conclusion":{"body":21,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":4},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#hosts-and-targets":{"title":2,"body":73,"breadcrumbs":5},"background/what.html#wait-a-minute":{"title":2,"body":33,"breadcrumbs":3},"hello-world/setup.html#other-tools":{"breadcrumbs":4,"body":86,"title":1},"hello-world/setup.html#a-project-directory":{"body":33,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":5},"background/what.html#what-is-an-os":{"breadcrumbs":2,"title":1,"body":88},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#creating-intermezzosjson":{"body":89,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":5},"background/what-kind-is-there.html#exokernels--unikernels":{"breadcrumbs":3,"title":2,"body":46},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#compiling-with--bootimage":{"body":159,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":5},"preface.html#principles":{"breadcrumbs":1,"title":1,"body":39},"background/index.html#background":{"title":1,"body":6,"breadcrumbs":1},"hello-world/setup.html#setting-up-a-development-environment":{"body":85,"breadcrumbs":7,"title":4},"background/tools.html#do-i-need-to-be-a-wizard":{"title":2,"body":77,"breadcrumbs":3},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#our-first-hello-world":{"body":42,"title":3,"breadcrumbs":6},"background/tools.html#assembly":{"title":1,"breadcrumbs":2,"body":380},"background/what-kind-is-there.html#what-kinds-of-os-are-there":{"title":2,"breadcrumbs":3,"body":138},"background/tools.html#what-tools-will-we-use":{"title":2,"breadcrumbs":3,"body":27},"hello-world/setup.html#a-virtual-machine":{"body":49,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":5},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#removing-the-standard-library":{"breadcrumbs":6,"title":3,"body":244},"hello-world/setup.html#the-compiler-and-other-tools":{"title":2,"body":56,"breadcrumbs":5},"hello-world/setup.html#stable-vs-nightly-rust":{"title":4,"body":53,"breadcrumbs":7},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#setting-up-a-project":{"body":116,"breadcrumbs":6,"title":3},"hello-world/setup.html#an-editor-or-ide":{"body":65,"breadcrumbs":5,"title":2},"hello-world/setup.html#thats-it":{"body":6,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":4},"background/tools.html#rust":{"body":122,"breadcrumbs":2,"title":1},"hello-world/setting-up-a-project.html#running-with--qemu":{"body":96,"breadcrumbs":5,"title":2},"background/what.html#creating-abstractions":{"body":169,"title":2,"breadcrumbs":3},"preface.html#the-name":{"body":154,"title":1,"breadcrumbs":1}},"length":36}}};
